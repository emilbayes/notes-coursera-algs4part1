Coursera - Algorithms I
=======================

Notes for the Coursera course [Algorithms I (Fall 2015)](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI)

All project code is written in Java with plots done in [Julia](julialang.org)
using [Gadfly.jl](http://gadflyjl.org/).

Steps to develop usable algorithms:

1. Model the problem
2. Find an algorithm to solve it
3. Fast enough? Fits in memory?
4. If not, figure out why
5. Find a way to address the problem
6. Iterate until satisfied
